# Quick Fix Guide - Project & Milestone Overview Issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Fixed: "column project_id does not exist"

This error has been **resolved** by fixing `attendanceService.ts` to use the correct column name (`milestone_id` instead of `project_id`).

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250108_complete_fix_safe.sql`
4. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

**Note**: This migration is **safe** and **idempotent** - it checks for existing tables/columns before creating them.

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Run this quick check query:

```sql
SELECT
  'Functions' as type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN ('calculate_milestone_budget', 'get_member_wage_config', 'calculate_daily_rate')
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Tables' as type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('project_expenses', 'invoices');
```

Expected result: Functions = 3, Tables = 2 ‚úì

### Step 3: Restart Your App

```bash
# If running locally
npm run dev

# Or refresh your browser if already running
```

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

- ‚úÖ **Column error resolved**: Fixed `attendanceService.ts` to use correct column names
- ‚úÖ **Project Financial Overview** now displays correctly
- ‚úÖ **Milestone Budget Reports** load properly
- ‚úÖ **Better error messages** instead of blank screens
- ‚úÖ **Handles missing data** gracefully
- ‚úÖ **All database functions** and tables created

## üß™ Test It

1. **Projects Page**: Go to `/projects` - should see all projects with budget info
2. **Project Detail**: Click a project - should see Financial Overview card
3. **Budget Report**: Navigate to a milestone's budget report - should see budget data or helpful message
4. **No Errors**: Check browser console (F12) - should be clean

### Symptom: "Function does not exist" error

- **Fix**: Re-run the migration script from Step 1

### Symptom: "column project_id does not exist"

- **Fix**: Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`)
