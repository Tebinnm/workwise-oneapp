- ✅ Access user management interface

### 2. Supervisor

**Team Control in Assigned Projects**

- ✅ View and manage assigned projects
- ✅ Manage attendance in assigned projects
- ✅ Create and manage recurring tasks in assigned projects
- ✅ Create, edit, and assign tasks in assigned projects

- ❌ Cannot modify wage configurations

### 3. Worker (Employee)

**Task-Level Access Only**

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

#### 1. Role Enum

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250110_remove_project_manager_role.sql`

- Removed `project_manager` role from `app_role` enum
- Updated enum to only include: `admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `client`
- Migrated existing project_manager users to supervisor role
- Created performance indexes on profiles and project_members tables

#### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250110_remove_project_manager_role.sql`

- Comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- Project-scoped access control using helper functions
- Policies for: profiles, projects, milestones, tasks, task_assignments, attendance, project_members, member_wage_config

**Helper Functions:**

- `user_has_project_access(user_id, project_id)` - Checks project access
- `user_has_milestone_access(user_id, milestone_id)` - Checks milestone access
- `get_user_role(user_id)` - Returns user's role

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Type Updates

**File:** `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

- Updated `app_role` enum to include only: `admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `client`
- Type definitions support three active roles

#### 2. Permission Hook

**File:** `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`

**Key Functions:**

- `isAdmin()` - Check if user is admin
- `isSupervisor()` - Check if user is supervisor
- `isWorker()` - Check if user is worker
- `canManageSystemUsers()` - Admin only
- `canCreateProjects()` - Admin only
- `canCreateMilestones()` - Admin + Supervisor
- `canCreateTasks()` - Admin + Supervisor
- `canDeleteTasks()` - Admin only
- `canManageFinancials()` - Admin only
- `canApproveAttendance()` - Admin + Supervisor

#### 3. Permission Service

**File:** `src/services/permissionService.ts`

**Service Methods:**

- `getUserAssignedProjectIds(userId)` - Get accessible project IDs
- `getUserAssignedMilestoneIds(userId)` - Get accessible milestone IDs
- `canUserAccessProject(userId, projectId, userRole)` - Check project access
- `canUserAccessMilestone(userId, milestoneId, userRole)` - Check milestone access
- `filterProjectsByAccess(projects, userId, userRole)` - Filter projects by access
- `filterMilestonesByAccess(milestones, userId, userRole)` - Filter milestones
- `filterTasksByAccess(tasks, userId, userRole)` - Filter tasks
- `getTeamMemberIds(userId, userRole)` - Get team member IDs
- `canManageUser(managerId, managerRole, targetUserId)` - Check user management access

#### 4. Component Updates

**AppSidebar** (`src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`)

- Filters projects and milestones based on user access
- Shows "User Management" only for admins
- Shows "Attendance" for admins/supervisors
- Shows "Create Milestone" only for admins/supervisors

**Projects Page** (`src/pages/Projects.tsx`)

- Filters projects based on user assignments
- Shows "New Project" button only for admins
- Redirects workers to only assigned projects

**TaskDialog** (`src/components/dialogs/TaskDialog.tsx`)

- Restricts task creation to admins/supervisors
- Workers can only update task status
- Delete button shown only for admins
- Timer controls restricted for workers with started tasks

**AttendanceManagement** (`src/pages/AttendanceManagement.tsx`)

- Filters milestones based on user access
- Admins see all milestones
- Supervisors see only assigned project milestones
- Attendance approval restricted to admins/supervisors

**UserManagement** (`src/pages/UserManagement.tsx`)

- Restricted to admins only
- Non-admins are redirected to dashboard
- Role options: Admin, Supervisor, Worker
- Updated role badge colors

**ProjectBoard** (`src/pages/ProjectBoard.tsx`)

- "Add Task" button shown only for admins/supervisors
- Workers see read-only board with ability to update assigned tasks

**ProjectDetail** (`src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`)

- "Edit Project" button shown only for admins
- "Add Milestone" button shown only for admins/supervisors
- Filtered milestone view based on user access

## Security Features

### Database Level (RLS)

✅ All permissions enforced at database level
✅ Cannot bypass UI restrictions via API calls
✅ Worker queries automatically filtered to assigned items
✅ Project-scoped access checks prevent cross-project data leaks

### Application Level

✅ UI elements hidden based on permissions
✅ Navigation restricted based on role
✅ API calls include permission checks
✅ Real-time filtering of data based on assignments

## Migration Path

### For Existing Installations

1. **Apply Database Migration:**

   ```bash
   # Run the migration
   psql -f supabase/migrations/20250110_remove_project_manager_role.sql
   ```

2. **Assign Users to Projects:**

   - Ensure all users are assigned to appropriate projects via `project_members` table
   - Workers should be assigned through task assignments
   - Supervisors should be explicitly assigned to project milestones

3. **Update User Roles:**

   - Review existing user roles
   - Ensure admin role is correctly set
   - Verify supervisors are assigned to appropriate projects

4. **Test Access:**
   - Test each role to verify correct access levels
   - Verify workers can only see assigned tasks
   - Verify supervisors are scoped to their projects

## Testing Checklist

### Admin Testing

- [ ] Can access user management
- [ ] Can see all projects and milestones
- [ ] Can create/edit/delete projects
- [ ] Can create/edit/delete tasks
- [ ] Can manage attendance across all projects
- [ ] Can configure wage settings

### Supervisor Testing

- [ ] Can see only assigned projects
- [ ] Can manage attendance in assigned projects
- [ ] Can create/edit tasks in assigned projects
- [ ] Can create/edit milestones in assigned projects
- [ ] Can manage project members in assigned projects
- [ ] Cannot delete tasks
- [ ] Cannot create or delete projects
- [ ] Cannot access user management
- [ ] Cannot modify wage configurations

### Worker Testing

- [ ] Can see only assigned tasks/milestones/projects
- [ ] Can update status of assigned tasks
- [ ] Can use task timer
- [ ] Cannot see unassigned projects
- [ ] Cannot create tasks
- [ ] Cannot access any management pages

## Known Limitations

1. **Worker Task Creation:** Workers cannot create tasks for themselves. This is by design - tasks must be assigned by supervisors or admins.

2. **Project Assignment Required:** Users must be explicitly assigned to projects through the `project_members` table to have access. New users won't see any projects until assigned.

3. **Role Changes:** Changing a user's role requires re-login for permission changes to take full effect due to client-side caching.

4. **Cross-Project Visibility:** Supervisors cannot see projects they're not assigned to.

## Benefits

✅ **Security:** All access control enforced at database level
✅ **Scalability:** Project-scoped permissions allow for multi-tenant-like operation
✅ **Clarity:** Clear separation of concerns between three roles
✅ **Flexibility:** Easy to modify permissions as needed
✅ **Performance:** Efficient filtering with proper indexes
✅ **User Experience:** Clean UI that shows only relevant information

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Thoroughly test all roles with real user scenarios
2. **Documentation:** Update user guides for each role
3. **Training:** Train users on their specific role capabilities
4. **Monitoring:** Monitor for any permission bypass attempts or issues
5. **Refinement:** Gather feedback and refine permissions as needed
