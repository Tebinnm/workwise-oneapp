# Kanban Board Drag & Drop Fix Summary

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Collision Detection Optimization**

- **Problem**: The custom collision detection strategy was overly complex and could cause inconsistent behavior when dragging tasks between columns.
- **Solution**: Simplified the collision detection algorithm to:
  - First check for pointer intersections (most accurate)
  - Prioritize column intersections over task intersections
  - Fall back to rectangle intersections when pointer detection is not available
  - Always prioritize column droppables in the results

### 2. **Improved Drag Interaction**

- **Problem**: Only the grip icon was draggable, making it difficult for users to grab tasks.
- **Solution**: Made the entire left section of the task card (including title and grip icon) draggable while keeping action buttons interactive:
  - Moved drag listeners to the title/grip area instead of the entire card
  - Maintained button functionality (Edit, More options) without interfering with drag
  - Added visual cursor feedback (grab/grabbing)

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**

- **Problem**: Limited visual feedback during drag operations made it unclear where tasks could be dropped.
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive visual feedback:
  - Active drag state shows ring around card being dragged
  - Hover state on columns when dragging over them
  - Empty column placeholders change appearance when being hovered during drag
  - Improved drag overlay with more task information (title, description, status badge)

### 4. **Better Empty Column Handling**

- **Problem**: Empty columns didn't provide clear visual feedback for drop zones.
- **Solution**: Enhanced empty column placeholder:
  - Shows "Drop here" text when hovering during drag
  - Changes border style from dashed to solid
  - Adds background color and primary border when hovered
  - Maintains consistent minimum height for better UX

### 5. **Robust Error Handling**

- **Problem**: Drag operations could fail silently without user feedback.
- **Solution**: Implemented proper error handling:
  - Try-catch blocks around database updates
  - Clear error messages via toast notifications
  - Success confirmations with status information
  - Console logging for debugging

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **DndContext**: Main drag and drop context with improved sensors and collision detection
2. **DroppableColumn**: Droppable containers for each status column (Open, In Progress, Done)
3. **SortableTaskCard**: Individual draggable task cards with enhanced UX
4. **DragOverlay**: Improved preview overlay showing task details during drag

### Drag Flow

1. User clicks and drags on task title/grip area
2. Collision detection identifies which column is being hovered
3. Visual feedback indicates valid drop zones
4. On drop, task status is updated in database
5. UI refreshes with new task positions
6. Budget calculations are triggered if callback is provided

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Drag Between Columns**: Test dragging tasks between all three columns (Open, In Progress, Done)
2. **Empty Columns**: Test dragging to and from empty columns
3. **Button Interaction**: Verify Edit and More buttons still work properly
4. **Mobile/Touch**: Test on touch devices if applicable
5. **Error Cases**: Test with network issues to ensure error handling works
6. **Multiple Tasks**: Test dragging when columns have many tasks
7. **Quick Movements**: Test rapid drag operations to ensure state updates correctly

## Known Limitations

1. Tasks can only be moved between columns, not reordered within a column (by design)
2. Drag operations require network connection for database updates
3. Multiple simultaneous drags from different users may cause conflicts (last write wins)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add reordering within columns with position tracking
2. Implement optimistic updates for better perceived performance
3. Add conflict resolution for concurrent drag operations
4. Support keyboard navigation for accessibility
5. Add drag and drop animations for smoother transitions
