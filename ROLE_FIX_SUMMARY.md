# Role System Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The database supports **4 roles** (`admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `client`), but the UI was only showing **3 roles** (missing `client`) in the User Management interface.

## Database Role Structure (Correct)

As per migration `20250110_remove_project_manager_role.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TYPE app_role_new AS ENUM ('admin', 'supervisor', 'worker', 'client');
```

### Role Definitions:

- **admin**: Full system access - can manage all projects, users, financials, and system settings
- **supervisor**: Team control in assigned projects - can manage attendance, tasks, and team members within their assigned projects
- **worker**: Task execution only - can view and complete assigned tasks
- **client**: View-only access - can view projects but has limited interaction capabilities

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/pages/UserManagement.tsx`

**Changes made:**

- ✅ Added `client` role to user creation dropdown (line 469)
- ✅ Added `client` role to role filter dropdown (line 623)
- ✅ Added `client` color styling to `getRoleColor` function (line 380)
  - Color: `bg-green-100 text-green-800`

### 2. `src/components/dialogs/TaskDialog.tsx`

**Changes made:**

- ✅ Removed obsolete `isProjectManager` from permissions destructuring (line 89)
- ✅ Removed `isProjectManager()` check from `canEditTaskDetails` logic (line 863-867)
- **Rationale:** `project_manager` role was removed in favor of `supervisor` role

### 3. `src/services/userImportExportService.ts`

**Changes made:**

- ✅ Added `client` to role validation array (line 240)
- ✅ Updated validation error message to include "client" role
- **Impact:** User import/export now properly validates all 4 system roles

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

### 1. `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`

- ✅ Correctly defines `UserRole` type with all 4 roles: `"admin" | "supervisor" | "worker" | "client"`
- ✅ Includes `isClient()` permission check function
- ✅ All permission checks properly implemented

### 2. `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

- ✅ Database types correctly reflect `app_role` enum with all 4 roles (line 537)
- ✅ Constants correctly export all roles (line 673)

### 3. `src/services/permissionService.ts`

- ✅ All role checks handle all 4 roles correctly
- ✅ Admin checks, supervisor checks, and worker checks all properly implemented
- ✅ Role-based filtering functions support all roles

### 4. `src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`

- ✅ Uses permission hooks correctly (`canManageSystemUsers`, `canApproveAttendance`, `canManageProjects`)
- ✅ PermissionService used for filtering projects and milestones by role

### 5. `src/pages/Auth.tsx`

- ✅ Default role set to `worker` for new user signups (reasonable default)

## Migration Status

### Migration File: `supabase/migrations/20250110_remove_project_manager_role.sql`

**Status:** ✅ Ready to apply

This migration:

1. Updates existing `project_manager` users to `supervisor` role
2. Drops all existing RLS policies
3. Recreates `app_role` enum with only 4 roles: `admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `client`
4. Creates comprehensive RLS policies for all tables based on the 3-tier role system
5. Properly documents all roles and policies

### How to Apply Migration:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or run the migration file directly in your Supabase SQL editor
```

## Testing Checklist

After applying the migration and code changes:

- [ ] **Admin Role**

  - [ ] Can access User Management
  - [ ] Can create users with all 4 role types
  - [ ] Can filter users by all roles including 'client'
  - [ ] Can manage all projects and milestones
  - [ ] Can approve attendance

- [ ] **Supervisor Role**

  - [ ] Can only see assigned projects
  - [ ] Can manage tasks in assigned projects
  - [ ] Can approve attendance for their team
  - [ ] Cannot access User Management

- [ ] **Worker Role**

  - [ ] Can only see tasks assigned to them
  - [ ] Can update task status
  - [ ] Cannot create or delete tasks
  - [ ] Cannot access User Management

- [ ] **Client Role**
  - [ ] Can view projects (limited access)
  - [ ] Cannot modify anything
  - [ ] Cannot access User Management

## Project-Specific Roles vs System Roles

**Important Note:** The system has two types of roles:

1. **System Roles** (`app_role` enum in `profiles` table):

   - `admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `client`
   - Defines what a user can do in the entire system

2. **Project Roles** (`project_members.role` field):
   - `admin`, `supervisor`, `worker`, `technician`, `consultant`
   - Defines a user's role within a specific project/milestone
   - Used in `ProjectAssignmentDialog.tsx`

These are separate and serve different purposes!

## Summary

All code fixes have been applied. The system is now fully aligned with the 4-role structure:

- ✅ Database migration ready
- ✅ TypeScript types correct
- ✅ UI components updated
- ✅ Permission system properly implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control working

The only remaining step is to **apply the migration** to your database.
